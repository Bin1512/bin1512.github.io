## Week 5

Title: An asymptotic preserving numerical scheme and a reduced order model for the radiative transfer equation

Speaker: Zhichao Peng (Michigan State University)

Location: Zoom (https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/63299293349)

Time: Thursday, Jan 27, 2022, 14.00-15.00

Abstract: As the Knudsen number goes to zero, the radiative transfer equation (RTE) asymptotically converges to its diffusion limit. On one hand, it is a challenge to design efficient numerical schemes preserving the underlying physical limit. On the other hand, this limit also suggests the existence of a low-rank structure in the angular space which can be utilized to design reduced order models (ROMs). In the first part of this talk, we present an asymptotic preserving method solving time-dependent RTE based on the micro-macro decomposition and Schur complement. The proposed method is unconditionally stable in the diffusive regime and has standard CFL conditions in the transport regime. In the second part of the talk, we present a reduced basis method to build an angular-space ROM for the steady state RTE.

## Week 6

Title: Numerical homogenization of geometric network models

Time: Thu 2022-02-03 14.00-15.00

Location: Zoom https://stockholmuniversity.zoom.us/j/62889720565

Speaker: Fredrik Hellman (Gothenburg University)

Abstract: A sheet of paper can structural mechanically be modeled as an elasticity equation on a graph with edges for the fibers and vertices for the fiber contact points. To solve such a fine model, however, the vast number of degrees of freedom poses a computational challenge. In this talk, we apply a homogenization technique to the fine model and obtain an upscaled problem expressed on a coarser finite element mesh and that is easier to solve. The introduction and analysis of a Scott–Zhang type interpolation operator and the necessary assumptions on the network are the main theoretical contributions of this work.

This is a joint work with Axel Målqvist, Morgan Görtz and Gustav Kettil.

## Week 7

Title: High-Order CutFEM with BDF on Time-Dependent Domains

Time: Thu 2022-02-10 14.00-15.00

Location: Zoom https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/63299293349

Speaker: Simon Sticko (Uppsala University)

Abstract: We consider fully discrete methods for solving the advection-diffusion equation on time-dependent domains. These methods use the high-order stabilized cut finite element method as spatial discretization and backward difference formulas (BDF) for time-stepping. We consider both the case when the domain is a d-dimensional bounded subset of R^d and when it is a (d-1)-dimensional manifold. We focus on combining Lagrange elements of order p with BDF of order p+1, with p<5. We show numerical experiments to investigate the order of convergence. For some test cases, we observe optimal order: p+1, while for others suboptimal.

## Week 8

Title: Finite difference methods for marine seismic exploration and earthquake sequence simulations

Time: Thu 2022-02-17 14.00-15.00

Location: Zoom https://stockholmuniversity.zoom.us/j/62889720565

Lecturer: Martin Almquist (Uppsala University)

Abstract: Marine seismic exploration uses pressure waves generated by an array of airguns, dragged behind a boat, to determine material properties of the subsurface. Mathematically, the problem may be formulated as the inverse problem of estimating parameters of the coupled acoustic-elastic wave equation. Given seismograms at point locations, we set up a misfit functional (MF) that measures the difference between simulated and recorded data. The gradient of the MF can be computed efficiently by solving the adjoint equations. We discuss the adjoint of the discrete equations and how seismogram data in the MF give rise to singular source terms.
Earthquake sequence simulations, which simulate faults over multiple seismic events, are now widely used in the earthquake modeling community. Unlike a dynamic rupture simulation of a single event, earthquake sequence simulations can be used to estimate recurrence intervals and study how fault-slip history influences future events. We discuss results from a benchmark problem that involves an elastic solid and a nonlinear rate-and-state friction law on the fault.

## Week 9

Title: Recent developments of a potential theory based Cartesian grid method for elliptic PDEs on irregular domains

Time: Thu 2022-02-24 14.00-15.00

Location: Zoom https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/63299293349

Speaker: Wenjun Ying (Shanghai Jiaotong University)

Abstract: This talk will be on a potential theory based Cartesian grid method for elliptic PDEs on irregular domains. The method solves a boundary value or interface problem of PDE in the framework of second-kind Fredholm boundary integral equations. It avoids some limitations of the traditional boundary integral method. It does not need to know or compute the fundamental solution or Green's function of the PDE. Instead, it allows the solution of variable coefficients and nonlinear PDEs. The method evaluates boundary and volume integrals involved indirectly by solving equivalent but much simpler interface problems on Cartesian grids, based on properties of single, double layer boundary integrals and volume integrals in potential theory. In addition to its taking advantage of the well-conditioning property of the second-kind Fredholm boundary integral equations, the method makes full use of fast solvers on Cartesian grids. The Cartesian grid method can also accurately compute nearly singular and hypersingular boundary integrals. In this talk, I will present recent developments of the method.

## Week 11

Title: Spacetime finite element methods for control problems subject to the wave equation

Time: Thu 2022-03-10 14.00-15.00

Location: Zoom https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/63299293349

Speaker: Erik Burman (UCL)

Abstract: We consider the null controllability problem for the wave equation, and analyse a stabilized finite element method formulated on a global, unstructured spacetime mesh. We prove error estimates for the control function given by the computational method. The proofs are based on the regularity properties of the control function given by the Hilbert Uniqueness Method, together with the stability properties of the numerical scheme. The order of the error estimates reflects the stability of the problem and the optimal  approximation of the finite element spaces, but are slightly suboptimal compared to direct interpolation. We will also comment on the convergence of the scheme for solutions with the minimal regularity.  Some numerical examples will be presented in one space dimension and time. The talk is based on joint work with Lauri Oksanen, Ali Feizmohammadi and Arnaud Münch.

## Week 13

Title:Modern discontinuous Galerkin methods for computational fluid dynamics

Time: Thu 2022-03-24 14.00-15.00

Speaker: Andrew Winters (Linköping)

Location:  KTH, 3721, Lindstedsvägen 25

Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods have a long history in computational physics and engineering to approximate solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations due to their high-order accuracy and geometric flexibility. However, DG is not perfect and there remain some issues. Over the past decade, DG has undergone an extensive transformation into its modern form; capable of robust, adaptive simulations for complex transient flows.

Solutions of non-linear conservation laws contain many complex phenomena such as discontinuities, singularities, and turbulence. These phenomena are all time dependent and feature multiple scales in space and time. A wide variety of low-order and high-order numerical methods have been developed over many decades. There is, however, a balancing act when applying either type of method to a given problem:

1) Low-order methods offer remarkable robustness but require a very large number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) to properly capture multi-scale non-linear phenomena.

2) High-order methods offer great capabilities to accurately capture non-linear phenomena while requiring a moderate number of DOFs. However, they often lack robustness.

One approach for a shock capturing framework is to blend a low-order finite volume method with a high-order nodal DG method. Through carful construction of the geometric terms, this strategy is generalisable to multi-dimensional curvilinear meshes.

The aim of this talk is to dissect and discuss a modern form of nodal DG spectral element methods. These DG methods combine favourable features of other methods, e.g., geometric flexibility of finite element methods, skew-symmetric formulations of finite difference methods, and entropy stable numerical fluxes from finite volume methods. Implementation aspects of this modern DG formulation will also be included.

## Week 14

Title: Block preconditioning the p-Stokes equations in ice-sheet models

Time: Thu 2022-03-31 14.00-15.00

Speaker: Christian Helanow (SU)

Location:  KTH, 3721, Lindstedsvägen 25

Abstract: The deformation of ice can accurately be modeled as non-linear Stokes flow. The constitutive equation for ice, relating strain rates to stresses, is that of a singular power law which when discretizing the system of equations gives rise to a poorly conditioned linear system. The system is of saddle-point nature and its character depends on e.g. the effective viscosity and chosen regularization parameter. This motivates the use of block preconditioners that explicitly take into account the properties of the underlying problem. In the context of ice-sheet modeling using the p-Stokes equations block preconditioners have been used and numerically investigated with a heuristic motivation. However, in more general non-Newtonian settings, with focus on Bingham fluids, bounds on the eigenvalues for the block-preconditioned Schur complement have been derived. We attempt to adapt the theory of these studies to include Schur-complement preconditioners for singular power-law fluids, and numerically investigate how the proposed block preconditioner is affected by the specifics of ice-sheet simulations.
