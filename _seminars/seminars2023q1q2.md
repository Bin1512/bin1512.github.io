## Week 6

Title: A simple and accurate numerical method for singular and near-singular integration

Time: 2023-02-09, 14.00-15.00

Speaker: Bowei Wu (UMass Lowell)

Location: Zoom [https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/63299293349](https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/63299293349)

Abstract: Boundary Value Problems (BVPs) are ubiquitous in engineering and scientific applications. One of the most robust and accurate methods for solving BVPs is the Boundary Integral Equation Method, which has the great advantage of dimensionality reduction: all of the unknowns reside on the boundary surface instead of in the volume. A key challenge when solving integral equations is that special quadrature methods are required to discretize the underlying singular and near-singular integral operators. Accurate discretization of these operators is especially important in, for example, problems that involve close structure-structure or fluid-structure interactions. In this talk, we present some recent advancements on singular and near-singular numerical integration based on one of the simplest quadrature methods -- the Trapezoidal rule.

## Week 7

Title: The projection method for high-order finite difference with summation-by-parts properties

Time: 2023-02-16, 14.00-15.00

Speaker: Gustav Eriksson (Uppsala)

Location: KTH, 3418, Lindstedsvägen 25

Abstract: High-order finite difference methods with summation-by-parts (SBP) properties for time-dependent wave propagation problems are considered. In recent times, the most common method for imposing boundary and interface conditions with SBP finite differences has been the simultaneous-approximation-term (SBP-SAT) method. The SAT method imposes the conditions weakly by adding a penalty term to the system. However, for some problems, the stability proofs with SBP-SAT are difficult and the spectral radii of the schemes can grow large. Here, we consider an alternative method that imposes the conditions strongly using orthogonal projections (SBP-P). For most problems, the stability proof with SBP-P is significantly simpler than with SBP-SAT. It follows directly if the PDE is well-posed. In this talk, I will introduce SBP finite differences and show how the projection method can be used to prove stability for a wide array of PDEs. Numerical results and comparisons between SBP-P and SBP-SAT will be presented for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with wall boundary conditions, the piecewise homogeneous dynamic Kirchoff-Love plate equation, and the second-order wave equation with non-conforming interfaces.

## Week 8

Title: Systematic search for singularities in 3D Euler flows

Time: 2023-02-23, 14.00-15.00

Speaker: Xinyu Zhao (McMaster U)

Location: Zoom [https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/63299293349](https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/63299293349)

Abstract: The local well-posedness of smooth solutions of 3D incompressible Euler equations has been established when the initial data is in the Sobolev space $H^s$ for $s > 5/2$.  However, it is still an open question whether these solutions develop finite-time singularities. Today, we will present a numerical study of this question where we systematically search for initial data that may lead to potential singularity through PDE-constrained optimization. The optimization problem is solved numerically using a state-of-the-art Riemannian conjugate gradient method where the Sobolev gradients are obtained through an adjoint method. The behavior of the obtained extreme flow, which features two colliding distorted vortex rings, suggests a finite-time singularity formation. This is based on a joint work with Bartosz Protas.
