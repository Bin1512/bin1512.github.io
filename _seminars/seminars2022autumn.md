Title: Towards Robust and Interpretable Scientific Machine Learning: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications

Time: 2022-09-01, 14.00-15.00

Speaker: Yeonjong Shin (KAIST)

Location: Zoom https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/63299293349

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has achieved unprecedented empirical success in diverse applications. It now has been applied to solve scientific problems, which has become an emerging field, Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). Many ML techniques, however, are very complex and sophisticated, commonly requiring many trial-and-error and tricks. These result in a lack of robustness and interpretability, which are critical factors for scientific applications. This talk centers around mathematical approaches for SciML, promoting robustness and interpretability. The first part is about how to embed physics into neural networks (NNs). I will present a general framework for designing NNs that obey the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The framework not only provides flexible ways of leveraging available physics information but also results in expressive NN architectures. The second part is about the training of NNs, one of the biggest challenges in ML. I will present an efficient training method for NNs - Active Neuron Least Squares (ANLS). ANLS is developed from the insight gained from the analysis of gradient descent training.

Title: Hybrid Projection Methods for Solution Decomposition in Large-scale Bayesian Inverse Problems

Time: 2022-09-15, 14.00-15.00

Speaker: Jiahua Jiang (Birmingham)

Location: KTH, 3721, Lindstedsvägen 25
 
Abstract: We develop hybrid projection methods for computing solutions to large-scale inverse problems, where the solution represents a sum of different stochastic components. Such scenarios arise in many imaging applications (e.g., anomaly detection in atmospheric emissions tomography) where the reconstructed solution can be represented as a combination of two or more components and each component contains different smoothness or stochastic properties. In a deterministic inversion or inverse modeling framework, these assumptions correspond to different regularization terms for each solution in the sum. Although various prior assumptions can be included in our framework, we focus on the scenario where the solution is a sum of a sparse solution and a smooth solution. For computing solution estimates, we develop hybrid projection methods for solution decomposition that are based on a combined flexible and generalized Golub-Kahan processes. This approach integrates techniques from the generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization and the flexible Krylov methods. The benefits of the proposed methods are that the decomposition of the solution can be done iteratively, and the regularization terms and regularization parameters are adaptively chosen at each iteration. Numerical results from photoacoustic tomography and atmospheric inverse modeling demonstrate the potential for these methods to be used for anomaly detection.
