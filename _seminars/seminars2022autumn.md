Title: Towards Robust and Interpretable Scientific Machine Learning: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications

Time: 2022-09-01, 14.00-15.00

Speaker: Yeonjong Shin (KAIST)

Location: Zoom https://kth-se.zoom.us/j/63299293349

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has achieved unprecedented empirical success in diverse applications. It now has been applied to solve scientific problems, which has become an emerging field, Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). Many ML techniques, however, are very complex and sophisticated, commonly requiring many trial-and-error and tricks. These result in a lack of robustness and interpretability, which are critical factors for scientific applications. This talk centers around mathematical approaches for SciML, promoting robustness and interpretability. The first part is about how to embed physics into neural networks (NNs). I will present a general framework for designing NNs that obey the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The framework not only provides flexible ways of leveraging available physics information but also results in expressive NN architectures. The second part is about the training of NNs, one of the biggest challenges in ML. I will present an efficient training method for NNs - Active Neuron Least Squares (ANLS). ANLS is developed from the insight gained from the analysis of gradient descent training.

Title: Hybrid Projection Methods for Solution Decomposition in Large-scale Bayesian Inverse Problems

Time: 2022-09-15, 14.00-15.00

Abstract: We develop hybrid projection methods for computing solutions to large-scale inverse problems, where the solution represents a sum of different stochastic components. Such scenarios arise in many imaging applications (e.g., anomaly detection in atmospheric emissions tomography) where the reconstructed solution can be represented as a combination of two or more components and each component contains different smoothness or stochastic properties. In a deterministic inversion or inverse modeling framework, these assumptions correspond to different regularization terms for each solution in the sum. Although various prior assumptions can be included in our framework, we focus on the scenario where the solution is a sum of a sparse solution and a smooth solution. For computing solution estimates, we develop hybrid projection methods for solution decomposition that are based on a combined flexible and generalized Golub-Kahan processes. This approach integrates techniques from the generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization and the flexible Krylov methods. The benefits of the proposed methods are that the decomposition of the solution can be done iteratively, and the regularization terms and regularization parameters are adaptively chosen at each iteration. Numerical results from photoacoustic tomography and atmospheric inverse modeling demonstrate the potential for these methods to be used for anomaly detection.

Title: Reduced order models for inverse scattering problems

Time: 2022-09-29, 14.00-15.00

Speaker: Jörn Zimmerling (Uppsala)

Location: KTH, 3721, Lindstedsvägen 25

Abstract: In inverse scattering one tries to determine the coefficients of a PDE from measurements of the field that is driven by the PDE. Broadly, methods in inverse scattering fall into two categories: (1) Qualitative methods that try to reconstruct the support of scatterers and (2) Quantitative methods that try to reconstruct the PDE coefficients. Here we will focus on wave equations and reconstructing the wave speed from remote measurements.

Quantitative methods often formulate the problem as a PDE constrained optimization. That is, the PDE is used to map coefficients to simulated data and the mismatch between this data with the measurements is minimized in some norm to retrieve the unknown coefficients.
 
In this seminar we propose two alternative approaches involving reduced order modeling. A reduced-order model is a small algebraic system that can be directly obtained from the measured data and captures key properties of the underlying wave dynamics. In the first approach, the inverse scattering problem is reformulated in terms of a minimization of the reduced-order model mismatch rather than data mismatch. In a second approach we use the reduced order model to estimate the wave inside the unknown medium to aid inversion.

The measured data in inverse scattering experiments depends non-linearly on the PDE coefficient, which leads PDE constraint optimization to converge to local minima without a sufficiently good initial guess. We show that the reformulation using reduced-order models leads to a better-behaved objective function that is able to reconstruct the unknown PDE coefficients even for a poor initial guess.
